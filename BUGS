[X] Formats don't work
	Missing % sign
[ ] Scope data is not working
	Converted to commands instead of attributes, but still, it's not the data I'm looking for
[X] scope_freq is getting labeled as DDR Voltage and appears only in expert view
	Apparently rebooting tangobox helps...
[X] Device server segfaults when restarted from Astor
	Problem appears only when setting up a new device
[ ] Device state is flapping between UNKNOWN and FAULT while reconnecting
[X] LED status is not showing up
	int type causes errors, 'int' works (wtf?)
[ ] Starting generator on one channel starts second channel too with previous parameters
	Looks like it's a bug in RP device or "generate" application
[ ] Scope data exceeds size limit (even if sending only 4 datapoints)
